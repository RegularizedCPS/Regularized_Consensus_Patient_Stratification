Regularized_Consensus_Patient_Stratification
============================================

This git repository contains the code for Regularized Consensus Patient Stratification. 

Regularized Consensus Patient Stratification is a method that allows integrative clustering of multiple-source data including both numerical and categorical data. Specifically, it formulates the problem as an optimization process with regularization. Unlike the traditional consensus clustering methods, MRCPS can automatically and spontaneously cluster both numerical and categorical data with any option of similarity metrics.
